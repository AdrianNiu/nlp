##Two main category of parsing

Constituency parsing
identify phrases and their hierarchical (is-a) relations (excludes terminal nodes)

Dependency parsing
identify grammatical relations (lots of them) between syntactic units (including terminal nodes)



##Validation method:
Macroaveraging: Compute performance for each class, then average.
Microaveraging: Collect decisions for all classes, compute contingency table, evaluate.
