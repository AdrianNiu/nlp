Test Corpus

Lexical sample − This kind of corpora is used in the system, where it is required to disambiguate a small sample of words.

All-words − This kind of corpora is used in the system, where it is expected to disambiguate all the words in a piece of running text.

##Two main category of parsing

Constituency parsing
identify phrases and their hierarchical (is-a) relations (excludes terminal nodes)

Dependency parsing
identify grammatical relations (lots of them) between syntactic units (including terminal nodes)



##Validation method:
Macroaveraging: Compute performance for each class, then average.
Microaveraging: Collect decisions for all classes, compute contingency table, evaluate.


Three barriers have impeded accurate identification of suicidal risk. 

1. suicidal behavior is relatively rare and predictive models often require large population samples.
2. risk assessment relies heavily on patient self-report, yet patients may be motivated to conceal their suicidal intentions. 
3. prior to suicide attempts, the last point of clinical contact of patients who die by suicide commonly involves providers with varying levels of suicidal-risk assessment training.
